- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArmyJM, I am trying to reconnect with a world I thought long lost to me, I  remember it was nearly 15 years ago I was still in high school I downloaded Blender and started to teach myself how to use it, at the  same time I took any classes related to programming or web development that were available, which wasn't much. I took web-design (Microsoft Frontpage was still a thing at the time), I also was taking Java and SQL courses that were available through my high school. My life took a very different turn however, I join the Army as an Aircraft  Maintainer and that is what I have been doing ever since. I have looked back at my high school days fondly and wish to rekindle my love for the creative art of game design, coding and modeling even if it doesn't lead anywhere professionally. I have been craving a creative outlet, I think this will be good for me and I hope to find like minded and friendly people along the way, I learn best when engaged with others, so here's to that future.

- 👀 I’m interested in Python, C, C++, anything game design related
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 3D modeling, Python & C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
